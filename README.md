# Sprocket Central Pty Ltd Data Set
I have recently started a KPMG Internship. The task is to analyze the major problem and the quality of the dataset received from the firm. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization. It needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy effectively.

The dataset received from the firm were:

* Customer Demographic
* Customer Address
* Transaction Data
* New Customer List

Module 1 Task:

The first Task is to look at the following datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd and identify all data quality issues. Once you've had a look at these datasets, draft an email to the client identifying all data quality issues. 

Module 2 Task:

The second task is to Create a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the approach we will be taking to identify which of the 1000 customers Sprocket Central Pty Ltd should target, based on this dataset. Explain the three phases:  Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation.

Module 3 Task:

The third task is to develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard. Specifically, the presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd' should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list. 


Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
